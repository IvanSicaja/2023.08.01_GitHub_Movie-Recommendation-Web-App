### 📚🔍 Project description: ⬇︎⬇︎⬇︎

### 💡 App Purpose

The **Custom AI Medical Diagnosis App** offers a **user-friendly interface** for uploading **medical images** such as **CT, MRI, X-ray, PET, and Mammography scans**, depending on the **training dataset**. Focused on **brain cancer, skin cancer, and lung pneumonia diagnoses**, the app employs a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** powered by **TensorFlow** and **Python**. After analysis, the **chatbot** provides a **text-based diagnosis** with corresponding **probability**, along with **medical advice**. Enhancing **user experience**, a friendly **doctor AI created avatar** interacts with users. Relevant **data** is saved in a **SQL database dynamically**. The app is designed with **Flask, Jinja2, Bootstrap, and JavaScript**, containerized with **Docker**, orchestrated with **Kubernetes**, and can be hosted on **AWS EKS** or any other platform which supports **Kubernetes**.

### 🧠 How It Works

PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS:

- **Data collection and preprocessing:** Since no access to the **official medical database**, a **custom database** should be created. Developed **Python script** that unifies the **width and the height of all images** in the database and unifies the **number of the image dimensions** (**number of the color channels, transparency, etc.**) to the **grayscale image**. Also developed the **Python script** which converts all **images** in a **.csv database** with **Pandas** where every row represents the **image instance normalized pixel value** together with the corresponding **class label**.
- **Build, train, and evaluate the neural network model:** **TensorFlow** was used to create a **convolutional neural network** from scratch, **train** and **save the CNN model**. A **validation accuracy score** was used for the **model validation**.
- **Building the web page frontend UI:** Because the idea of this project is to build a **full stack deployed app**, it was needed to develop the **entire web page**. **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework** was used for the **frontend development**.
- **Building the web page backend:** As a **backend Python framework**, **Flask** is used. It allows us to get the **uploaded medical images** from the front end (**CT, MRI, X-ray, PET**). The **image** is converted with **Python backend function** to the corresponding **array form**, which was used for the **model training** with **TensorFlow and Keras**, and sent to the trained **convolutional neural network model** for **analysis**. The **result** that we got from the **neural network** is encoded to the corresponding **class** and sent back to the frontend like the **diagnosis text result** with corresponding **probability** to the **user** with the usage of **Jinja2**.
- **Deployment:** The **entire app** is **containerized** with the usage of **Docker Desktop** and the app's **Docker image** is uploaded to the **Docker Hub platform**. For the **deployment** is used **Google Kubernetes container orchestration tool**. The app is deployed locally with **Minikube** and tested for **performance**. The **domain** is bought on the **Namecheap platform** and the app can be deployed on any platform which supports **Kubernetes** such as: **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS->EKS), Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, etc.

### ⚠️ Note

This concept is for **local use only**, and significantly **improved training data** is essential for **real-world applications**.
